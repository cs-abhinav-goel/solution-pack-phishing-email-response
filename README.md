This Solution Pack ships with the following simulation scenarios.

#### 1. Scenario: Phishing Email
This scenario generates an example alert of Type 'Suspicious Email' in FortiSOAR Alerts module.

- Demo alert created is an example of a default email ingestion using Data Ingestion Feature
- Alert fields are mapped with information from an email, such as sender email id, reporter email id, any attachment, etc.
- User can execute OOB investigation playbook against alert **Investigate Suspicious Email** that utilizes email information (sender, receiver, subject, body, header, sender domain, etc) for analyzing the case and suggesting remediation action.

#### 2. Utility Playbook: Email (Manual Upload) - Investigate

This playbook adds an action to alert of Type "Suspicious Email", which allows user to attach an exported email file, either in .eml or .msg file format to alert. 

The moment above alert is created, the playbook will extract email metadata from uploaded email file and map with alert fields.

Navigate to generated alert and note the following:
- Attached  Email, if it contains an attachment, its extracted and then correlated as IOC 
- Alert field are mapped with information from email, such as sender email Id, reporter email Id, any attachment, etc.
- User can then execute OOB investigation playbook against alert 'Investigate Suspicious Email' that utilizes email information (sender, receiver, subject, body, header, sender domain, etc) is for analyzing the case and suggesting remediation action.

**Investigating Suspicious Email**: User can launch "Investigate Suspicious Email" playbook from an alert. This playbook will perform following automated tasks:

- Performs Spoofing and SPF checks
- Checks for particular keyword (user can configure same in playbook)
- If URL IOCs are found, it prompts user to mark this phishing attempt as **Drive by Download**. User gets more information about URLs
